# eUtranPagingPerf
Simulation of eUtran paging performance:
- memory usage and related drops
- queueing delay and related drops
- scheduled paging records and related blocking
- eUtran paging efficiency

Two MATLAB simulations are provided through the files "blockingRate.m" and "schedPageRecDist.m", both using the main function "eUtranPagingPerf.m". You can write your own simulations based on these two simulation files (using one of them as templates). All folders in this repository are required to run simulations but there is no need to include them manually in your path for both simulations or if you used them as templates.
