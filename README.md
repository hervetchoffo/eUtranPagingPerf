# eUtranPagingPerf
Simulation of eUtran paging performance:
- memory usage and related drops
- queueing delay and related drops
- scheduled paging records and related blocking
- eUtran paging efficiency

Two MATLAB simulations are provided through the files "blockingRate.m" and "schedPageRecDist.m", both using the main function "eUtranPagingPerf.m". You can write your own simulations based on these two simulation files as examples.
