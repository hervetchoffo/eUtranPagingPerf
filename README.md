# eUtranPagingPerf
Simulation of eUtran paging performance:
- memory usage and related drops
- queueing delay and related drops
- scheduled paging records and related blocking
- eUtran paging efficiency

Two simulations are provided through the files "blockingRate.m" and "schedPageRecDist.m", both using the main function "eUtranPagingPerf.m". You can write your own simulation based on these two files as examples.
